What is/are the business question(s) this project will answer?
What data will be used to answer this question? Is the data capable of providing the information you are looking for?
Who is the audience of this visualization (to whom are these findings ultimately being presented)?
 
Your boss Sylvia is the VP of Sales and she is conducting a review of the company discount 
policy. As research for her review, she has asked you to perform an exploratory analysis of 
the Super Store discount data. Specifically, Sylvia has asked you to investigate if there is 
a relationship between discounted sales and profit, and how much the company is profiting or 
losing based on discounted sales.

She also wants to see if there are opportunities for efficiencies with respect to how 
discounts are handled. Perhaps certain customers are receiving more discounts than other 
customers. Perhaps certain product categories or product segments are receiving more discounts
than others. Sylvia has given you wide latitude to explore this question however you see fit, 
and will ultimately make a recommendation to the board of directors based on your findings.
