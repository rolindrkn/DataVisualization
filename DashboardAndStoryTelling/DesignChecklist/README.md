This checklist is meant to be a reminder of some important considerations for your
data storytelling. As you develop your own process, try to keep these points in mind.
Not all of these considerations will apply to every project, so part of your job is to
balance and prioritize these factors.1
Identify and address the following:
## Who
• Stakeholders - Define the goals, requirements, and resources for the data story that
you want to tell
• Audience - Understand the level of detail, explanation, and format that will best
communicate your story for the intended audience
• Subject-Matter Experts - Verify the logic and accuracy of your data story, whenever
possible, with feedback and critiques from people who are familiar with the domain
from which your data story comes
## What
• Data Sources - Identify what data is available for you to use to tell your story
• Data Quality - Assess the cleanliness of the data
• Data Timeliness - Determine the recency or “freshness” of the data
## Why
• Business Case/Other Goals – Concisely articulate the purpose of the story
• Intended Outcome – Set some goals for the outcome of the story and what the
take-aways and next steps (if applicable) are for the audience

1 For example, the goals of the stakeholders or audiences may not be met by the
available data, so either the story has to be presented in a different way or
supplementary data needs to be found.
